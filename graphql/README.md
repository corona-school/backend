# GraphQL for Lernfair

We try to leverage GraphQL as a query language for our API. 
Maybe we're able to reduce complexity a bit with that (a lot of repetition in CRUD endpoints, a lot of data "massaging", missing authorizations / validations). 

We're using ApolloGraphQL as the runtime implementation, TypeGraphQL to automatically turn Typescript types into GraphQL Schemas, and TypeGraphQL-Prisma to automatically generate simple CRUD Mutations from the Prisma (database) Schema. Prisma is our ORM (alongside TypeORM, thus `npx prisma introspect` needs to be run once in a while to keep the schemas in sync). 

To rebuild the Prisma runtime and autogenerated TypeGraphQL types (found in `/graphql/generated/`) run `npx prisma generate` after uncommenting the `generator typegraphql` in `/prisma/schema.prisma`.
We currently do this manually and check the results into version control, as typegraphql-prisma is still very experimental.

Please DO NOT manually change the `/graphql/generated` folder. If changes are needed, have a look at the [Resolver Enhance Maps](https://prisma.typegraphql.com/docs/advanced/additional-decorators), or [write your own Resolvers / Fields](https://prisma.typegraphql.com/docs/advanced/custom-operations) outside of that folder. 

The GraphQL can be explored when visiting `https://[backend-host]/apollo` which shows an interactive UI. Add `{ "authorization": "[SECRET ACCESS TOKEN]" }` to the HTTP Headers field, then you should be able to perform a query like:

```gql
query {  
  pupils(where: { firstname: { contains: "M" } }) { 
  	id  
    firstname
    lastname
  } 
}
```
